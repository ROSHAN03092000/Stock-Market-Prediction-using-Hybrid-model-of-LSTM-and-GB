# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-LSTM-and-GB-
The stock market serves as a platform for the exchange of financial products, supporting corporate capital raising and offering possibilities for both private and public entities and people to participate. However, it comes with a number of difficulties, including market volatility, information asymmetry, worries about liquidity, and regulatory compliance. The creation of trustworthy prediction models is essential for assisting investors in navigating these difficulties and coming to wise judgements.
In recent years, the application of ML techniques, specifically LSTM and GB, has gained attention in stock market prediction. LSTM, a recurrent neural network architecture, is capable of capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in time series data. GB, an ensemble learning technique, combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model. We aim to create a hybrid LSTM-GB model for stock market price prediction, aiming to overcome the limitations of conventional techniques by fusing the strengths of LSTM and GB. We will leverage existing LSTM and GB theories and algorithms, emphasizing their benefits in capturing temporal relationships and supporting ensemble learning, while also recognizing potential drawbacks like overfitting and challenges with hyper-parameter adjustment. 
Our methodology involves collecting historical stock market data, preprocessing and transforming the data, training the hybrid model using Python with Keras for LSTM implementation and sklearn for GB, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as mean absolute error and root mean square error. Our study reveals that the hybrid LSTM-GB model for stock market price prediction outperforms conventional techniques, demonstrating improved accuracy, reduced mean absolute error and root mean square error, successful capture of short-term and long-term dynamics, and the potential to provide valuable insights for informed investment decision-making.
